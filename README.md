# Web-Design-Challenge
This is my submission for the Week 11 Web homework assignment for the U of O coding bootcamp.<br>
I used data for this project that was acquired from the CollegeScorecard API. I was using similar data for our first group <a href="https://github.com/hedeencharles/group_project01">project</a> and decided to dive into some more of the tends and data I thought might also be interesting pertaining to admissions and applications data and demographics. I decided to look at what percentage of applicants in PAC-12 schools were women from 2001-2018.
